========================
Initial Setup:
========================

1. Set the path to the file that holds all the IPTables rules.
  - This is located in the file dyndns_hosts_updater.py
  - The variable looks like "iptables_file = '/etc/iptables.up.rules'"

=========================
To add a new DYNDNS Host:
=========================

1. Add a line to dyndns_hosts.csv
  - Format: <host_name>,<ip_address>
  - Note: the ip address doesn't need to be correct as it will be
        pulled from the DNS server when the script is run.  This field
         will house the current IP addressbetween runs of the script.
  - example: "testhost.moneydesktop.com,127.0.0.1"

2. Add a comment and rule to the current IPTables config file or create
        the rule in Webmin.
  - Format:
        # <host_name>
        -A INPUT -s <ip_address> -j ACCEPT
  - Example:
        "# testhost.moneydesktop.com"
        "-A INPUT -s 127.0.0.1 -j ACCEPT"
  - Note: This is so I know where the rule goes. All the script does
        is look for the commented hostname and then insert the rule
        over whatever is below it currently.
          If you opt for webmin make sure the "Rule Comment" field has
        "<host_name>" in it.
